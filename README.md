# Pigi

The Parallel Interferometric GPU Imager (Pigi; pronounced like 'piggy') is a prototypal imager for radio astronomy currently in development, with the eventual aim to be optimized to run on supercomputing topology (multiple compute nodes) and take advantage of graphics processing units (GPUs).

It is not (yet?) intended for general use.

This work is funded by the Curtin Institute of Computation and the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre.
